# MUSS
MUSS is the Manchester University Software System. It is an operating system that was designed and built at Manchester University
for MU5. It was designed to be portable, and was ported to MU6-G, PDP-11, VAX and MC68000. Some computer manufacturers of the time
also took an interest.

A tape of source code was recovered in April 2018, there is more about the story [here](https://robs-old-computers.com/2018/05/03/muss-source-code/).
The code cannot be published yet (waiting for permission from Manchester University).

The long term aim of this project is to get MUSS running once more. Since the recovered source code is from the post-MU5 era, the most
likely target is the PDP-11 or VAX.

The initial effort is build an implementation of FLIP to translate the Flocoder files into compilable MUSL source code.
